				<div class="help-text">
					These samples and demos illustrate most of the capabilities that you can take
					advantage of with MacHTTP-js right out of the box. In most cases, each example has a
					"Try it!" link that will run the sample and a "view source" link that will let you 
					see how it works on the inside. Most of the example files are well-documented and
					should provide more technical users with some insights into what goes on under the
					hood with MacHTTP-js. Users are encouraged to submit more samples and demos by making
					pull requests to the GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/machttp/machttp-js-samples" target="git">https://github.com/machttp/machttp-js-samples</a>

			<h3>Index and Error Files</h3>
			By default, MacHTTP-js will look for a file called "index.jhtml" when a request is made for a URL that
			references a directory. It then looks for "index.html" if it can't find the ".jhtml" file. Finally, for URL
			requests that cannot be found or otherwise handled by the server, MacHTTP-js will look for a file called "error.jhtml"
			at the top level of its document tree and return it with appropriate error messages.<p />
		</div>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>index.jhtml</b> - 
			<a href="index.jhtml" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=index.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This is the file you are curently viewing.
		</p>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>error.jhtml</b> - 
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=error.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			A simple error file that returns a brief error message and the offending URL to the user.
		</p>

		<hr class="small-hr" />
		<div class="help-heading" id="tag_startup">
			<h3>Startup Script</h3>
			MacHTTP-js runs an internal start-up script each time it is launched to take care of
			regular housekeeping issues and to make sure that the server's internal functions are properly
			configured. Its last step is to launch a user-specified start-up script if one is present. To 
			define a start-up script, go to MacHTTP-js Settings and select the Apps tab. Then select the Javascript
			file you would like MacHTTP-js to run when it launches.<p />
			These scripts can do anything you'd like, though they only run once. A useful application of the start-up
			script is to have it launch any OnePager apps you may have installed.<p />
		</div>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>Startup Script Example </b> - 
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=javascript&show=scripts/startup.js" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This start-up script reads some configuration data from the MacHTTP-js object database and uses that to 
			launch the newsConsole OnePager.<p />
		</p>

		<div class="help-heading" id="tag_jhtml">
			<h3>JHTML Pages</h3>
			JHTML files are regular HTML documents with the option to have embedded Javascripts that are run on the 
			server before it returns the contents. The scripts can create additional content to be merged into the
			HTML before it is returned to the browser.<p />
			Additional JHTML documentation can be found in the MacHTTP-js Quick Start page available under its "Help" menu.<p />
		</div>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>JHTML Features</b> - 
			<a href="jhtml.jhtml" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=demos/jhtml.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This is an example that shows various ways to embed Javascripts in a JHTML file and the sorts of things you can
			do with server-side JavaScript.<p />
		</p>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>View Source Tool</b> - 
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=markdown&show=README.md" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=viewsource.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This is a fairly elaborate example that is used by this page. It is a JHTML page that can be used to view the contents
			of other pages. It relies on the Ace text editor (which is included inside MacHTTP-js) to show (and edit) various files.
			This example does not save any changes you make to the file.<p />

		<div class="help-heading" id="tag_actions">
			<h3>Actions and CGIs</h3>
			CGIs (Common Gateway Interface) are scripts that are run by MacHTTP-js to perform some quick action and return it
			as results to the calling browser. The CGI files are Javascript (.jcgi or .js) that is loaded and run by MacHTTP-js when
			the CGI is requested. It is the CGI's job to create the return results and to also set the HTTP response code, MIME type, and
			any other headers required. It relies on the Express.js methods that are part of the "response" object. The MacHTTP-js
			Quick Start guide has more details on where to find documentation on Express.js.<p />
			Actions are a direct descendent (though more powerful) of their counterparts in the classic MacHTTP and WebSTAR applications.
			Actions specify a "route" or "path" and a script that handles requests that match the specified "route." Actions are used
			to allow a whole directory or subdirectory of items to be handled by the same script. For example, a route like "/thumbnail/:imgID"
			might allow you to send URLs like "/thumbnail/0001.jpg" which could run a script that created and returned a thumbnail version of
			the file 0001.jpg.<p />
		</div>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>Action Test</b> - 
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=javascript&show=demos/actiontest.jcgi" target="view">view source</a><br />
			To try this action, use the "Actions" settings in MacHTTP-js to define a new action called "actiontest" with <A NAME=""></A>
			Action Path that is "/actiontest/:id" (no quotes). Then select the actiontest.jcgi file as the script for the action. Then
			visit a URL like "http://localhost:3000/actiontest/42?searchArgs=MrWheat" to see how it works.<p/>
			Note, you must quit and restart MacHTTP-js before new actions will work. See <a href="http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use" target="expr">http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use</a>
			for more details on how to define routes/paths and how to access various Express.js parameters.<p />

		<p class="help-text">
			<b>Test.jcgi</b> - 
			<a href="scripts/test.jcgi" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=javascript&show=scripts/test.jcgi" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This is a very simple CGI that returns a JSON result.
		</p>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>Firmata Test.jcgi</b> - 
			<a href="scripts/firmataTest.jcgi" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=javascript&show=scripts/firmataTest.jcgi" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This JCGI illustrates using the Arduino Firmata package to allow MacHTTP-js to talk to an Arduino microcontroller.
			The "firmata" node.js package is included inside MacHTTP-js and can be used in scripts. This JCGI requires <A NAME=""></A>
			Arduino to be plugged into a serial port on the computer running MacHTTP-js. That Arduino should be running the
			"Standard Firmata" sketch (found under Examples in your Arduino IDE). Running this JCGI will start blinking the onboard LED.
			Because it uses a background process (SetInterval), it will continue until you restart MacHTTP-js.

		<div class="help-heading" id="tag_onepagers">
			<h3>One Pagers</h3>
			OnePagers are a self-contained Web application that can be launched and run inside of a native window created by
			MacHTTP-js for your app. This allows you to use HTML5 and Javascript on your desktop computer to create small
			applications that look and run like native ones. The fundamental concept is to combine serve side processing (scripts) with
			client side processing (HTML and Javascripts) into a single file that can be easily shared and installed with just
			a file copy.<p />
		</div>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>News Console OnePager</b> - 
			<a href="one_pagers/newsConsole.jhtml" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=one_pagers/newsConsole.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This OnePager opens up a new native window in MacHTTP-js and shows the most current news headline. It updates itself
			once a minute and will run until you close its window.<p />
		</p>
		<p class="help-text">
			<b>Arduino OnePager</b> - 
			<a href="one_pagers/arduino2.jhtml" target="view">Try it!</a> -
			<a href="viewsource.jhtml?kind=html&show=one_pagers/arduino2.jhtml" target="view">view source</a><br />
			This is by far the most complex (and geekiest) of OnePagers. It is an example of how to use MacHTTP-js to talk to 
			the "Internet of Things" (IoT) from your desktop computer. This example requires that you have an Arduino microcontroller
			connected to the serial port on the computer running MacHTTP-js. You also need to have the Arduino running the sketch that is
			embedded in the source file (at the end) of this OnePager.<p />
			Once launched, you need to fill in the name of the serial port that the Arduino is connected to and hit "Connect" in the
			native window that this OnePager creates. 
			If you are using a relatively "normal" Arduino like an Uno or Genuino, this app will then allow you to toggle the status of the onboard
			LED (connected to pin 13) from your desktop computer. More elaborate experiments are left as an exercise to the hacker.<p />
